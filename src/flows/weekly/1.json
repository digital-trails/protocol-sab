You'll first be asked to complete some surveys about your mental health, thinking patterns, and daily functioning. Then, we'll give you some more information about the rationale for this program and explain how to get the most out of the app. \n\nBe sure to reach out to the research team at MindTrailsMovement@uvahealth.org if you have any questions or concerns. \n\nReady to get started?
